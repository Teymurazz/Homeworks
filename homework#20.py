and prints a greeting message. Call the function to greet the user by their name.

def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hello,{name}, nice to see you!")

greet_user("Teymuraz")


B. Write a function named calculate_area that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter 
and returns the area of the circle. Print the area of a circle with radius 5 using this function.

def calculate_area(radius):
    S = 3.14 * radius ** 2
    print(f"Area of circle equal {S}")

calculate_area(5)


C. Create a function named calculate_total_cost that takes the price and quantity of an 
item as parameters and returns the total cost. Print the total cost for an item with a 
price of $10 and a quantity of 3 using this function.

def total_cost(price, quantity):
    total = price * quantity
    print(f"total price is {total}")

total_cost(10, 3)




D. Write a function named 'hello' that prints "Hello world". Call this function two times.

def hello():
    print("Hello world")

hello()
hello()

OR

def hello():
    for i in range(2):
        print("Hello World")

hello()
