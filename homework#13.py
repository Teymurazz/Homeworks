Instructions: Write Python code for each of the following tasks. 
Make sure to use if statements appropriately to achieve the desired outcomes. 
If appropriate, comment your code to explain each step.

- If Statements -
A. Create any variable with Boolean value. Print 'My variable evaluates to True'
if this variable is 'True', otherwise print 'My variable evaluates to False'.

2. If temperature is in interval from 10 to 24 degrees (both included), print 
'It\'s a nice weather. Let\'s go for a walk.'.
3. If temperature is above 24 degrees, print 'It\'s quite hot, I need an AC.'.

temperature = 15
if temperature < 10:

- Dictionary Methods -
A. Create a nested dictionary. Get any inner value using multiple key-indexing.

nested_dict = {
    'person1': {
        'name': 'Tim',
        'age': 40},
        'person2': {
        'name': 'Bob',
        'age': 30,}
}

print(nested_dict["person1"]["name"])

B. Create a dictionary with your personal data (name, surname, age, family status,
gender). Ask user for any key in your dictionary. Print the value of the given
key from the dictionary. Try to ask all keys.

info = {"name": "Tim",
        "surname": "Safarov",
        "age": 40,
        "job": "developer"

}
print(info["surname"])

print(info.keys())

C. Create a dictionary with stock data of clothes (cloth name + amount). Let 
the user choose any of keys and add some count to it.

cloth = {
    "hat": 3,
    "pants": 9,
    "shirts": 25,
    "shoes": 8,
    "socks": 10
}
cloth["socks"]+=15
print(cloth)

D. Copy any dictionary from previous tasks. Print it.

cloth = {
    "hat": 3,
    "pants": 9,
    "shirts": 25,
    "shoes": 8,
    "socks": 10
}
dubl = cloth.copy()
print(dubl)

E. Clear the dictionary from Task D. Print the length of this dictionary.

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()

F. Create an empty dictionary. Let the user add data to it (key & value). Choose
any topic (books, cars, info, items, grades...) and let the user fill it with
minimum 4 key-value pairs.

my_dict = {}
countries = input("Enter 4 countries and separate them by space:").split()
capitals = input("Enter the capitals of this countries and separate them by space:").split()
my_dict = dict(zip(countries, capitals))
print(my_dict)

G. You have the following dictionary:
car = {
    "brand": "Chevrolet",
    "model": "Camaro",
    "year": 2017
}

Create a 'not_found_message' variable. Make it equal appropriate "not found" message.
Try to get 'year's and 'color's values from the 'car'. Set the default value to 
our "not found" message.

not_found_message = "not found"
print(car.get("color", not_found_message))

H. Print the first 6 keys from the following dictionary (hint: you should use 
'list()' method to convert dict_keys to list and indexing to get the appropriate
portion of data):
countries_capitals = {
    "USA": "Washington, D.C.",
    "Canada": "Ottawa",
    "United Kingdom": "London",
    "France": "Paris",
    "Germany": "Berlin",
    "Japan": "Tokyo",
    "Australia": "Canberra",
    "Brazil": "Bras√≠lia",
    "India": "New Delhi",
    "South Africa": "Pretoria",
}

lst = list(countries_capitals)
print(lst[0:6])

I. You have the following dictionary:
programming_languages = {
    "Python": {
        "designed_by": "Guido van Rossum",
        "first_appeared": 1991,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "High"
    },
    "JavaScript": {
        "designed_by": "Brendan Eich",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "Very High"
    },
    "Java": {
        "designed_by": "James Gosling",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Object-oriented",
        "typing": "Static",
        "popularity": "High"
    },
    "C++": {
        "designed_by": "Bjarne Stroustrup",
        "first_appeared": 1985,
        "paradigm": "Multi-paradigm",
        "typing": "Static",
        "popularity": "Moderate"
    }
}

Using in f-strings print the year Python was appeared value.

print(f"The year Python first appeared is {programming_languages["Python"]["first_appeared"]}")


J. You have the following code snippet:
tasks = {
    "Alice": ["Buy groceries", "Finish report", "Call the doctor"],
    "Bob": ["Walk the dog", "Pay bills", "Read a chapter"]
}

selected_person = "Alice"
new_task = "Go to the gym"

Add the new task to the selected person's tasks. Print the tasks & length of tasks 
before and after edition.

print(len(tasks))
selected_person = "Alice"
new_task = "Go to the gym"
tasks[selected_person].append(new_task)
print(len(tasks))

K. There is a dictionary method that helps to create a dictionary with a collection
of keys and apply a default value to that key. Using that method create a dictionary
with all values equal to the '[0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]' list and keys should only be
the numbers from 0 to 4, so your dictionary should look like:
digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_dict = {
    0: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    1: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    2: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    3: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
    4: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
}

You should use list comprehension in this task.

Then you should print some portion from the list values of a dictionary. The
portion size depends on a key you are using to index the list.

keys = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
lst = [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
my_dict = dict.fromkeys(keys, lst)
print(my_dict)
print(my_dict[1][1:3])


L. Print all items, values, keys from 'programming_languages' dictionary.

print(programming_languages.items())
print(programming_languages.keys())
print(programming_languages.values())





M. Remove 'Java' from 'programming_languages' dictionary & get its value. Print it.

print(programming_languages["Java"])
programming_languages.pop("Java")
print(programming_languages)


N. Remove the last item from the following dictionary and print it:
car = {
    "brand": "Ford",
    "model": "Mustang",
    "year": 1964
}
car.pop("year")
print(car)

O. Expand 'programming_languages' dictionary with the following data:
language_to_add = {
    "PHP": {
        "designed_by": "Rasmus Lerdorf",
        "first_appeared": 1995,
        "paradigm": "Server-side scripting",
        "typing": "Dynamic",
        "popularity": "Moderate"
    }
}

programming_languages.update(language_to_add)
print(programming_languages)


P. Use 'setdefault' method on any dictionary.

countries_capitals.setdefault("Germany", "Berlin")

Q. Which Data Types can be represented as values of any dictionary?

All data types

R. In the following example:
data = {
    "Python3.x": {
        "Wep Development", "Machine Learning", "Penetration Testing", "Game Development"
    }
}

It's giving an error if you try to get 'Python2.x' in this way:
data["Python2.x"]
Edit this code so it doesn't return an error.

data["Python2.x"] = {"Data Analitics", "Machine Learning", "Web Development"}
print(data["Python2.x"])

Quiz. (Dictionaries)
1. Which of the following are true of Python dictionaries:
    a) Dictionaries are mutable
    d) Dictionaries can be nested to any depth
    e) Dictionaries are accessed by key
    

2. Consider this dictionary:
    d = {'foo': 100, 'bar': 200, 'baz': 300}
    What is the result of this statement:
    d['bar':'baz']

    a) (200, 300)
    b) [200, 300]
    c) 200 300
    d) It raises an exception

3. Suppose x is defined as follows:
    x = [
        'a',
        'b',
        {
            'foo': 1,
            'bar':
            {
                'x': 10,
                'y': 20,
                'z': 30
            },
            'baz': 3
        },
        'c',
        'd'
    ]

What is the expression involving x that accesses the value 30?

x[2]['bar']['z']
